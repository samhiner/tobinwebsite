       As a sixth-year IB student actively pursuing the Congressional Award, I am well aware of the inherent value that community service has on helping others. In my continuous pursuit to serve my community, I have completed over 200 community service hours since 6th grade, with 150 of those hours being from my time as a high school student. To provide a wide range of meaningful service, I have held active roles for a variety of organizations, all of which have had a significant impact on me and the improvement of the community.       <br><br>

For the past seven years, I have been a community volunteer for Saint Therese Catholic Church. I  altar serve on Sunday mornings, cook meals at the annual Thanksgiving Dinner for those in need, act as an event leader for the annual Vacation Bible School week-long camp, and much more.        <br><br>

As a Community Awareness Volunteer, I represent the Ada Jenkins Center at local community events. To spread awareness of the Center and our Mission, I assist with activism and connect with officials and community members about our services, and I help organize and expand our scope of influence through participation at community events. As a Docent, I work with the Director of Development to organize and lead volunteer training. I educate groups of new volunteers about the economic hardships of which many experience, different opportunities to make a difference, and lead tours of the Ada Jenkins Center.      <br><br>

I am also a Red Cross Blood drive leader, having hosted my last blood drive on January 4th, 2020, and planning on hosting more in the future.
